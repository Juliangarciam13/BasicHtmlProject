        <p>
            The Marathon is the athletic test par excellence, highly demanding and long distance. This foot race has
            <br>
            a total distance of 42 km and 195 meters and today enjoys great popularity throughout the world. <br>
            Carrying out this test with full guarantees of finishing it or getting a good mark implies good <br>
            preparation, both at the training level and at the nutritional level. The specific training sessions to <br>
            prepare for the marathon begin months before, it is also at this time that diet must be taken care of
            especially <br>
            in order to maintain a good state of health and to be able to perform and recover in the most optimal way.
            <br>
            In this article and video you will learn how the marathon diet should be. <br>

                    Make a varied and balanced diet, that is, make a correct daily intake of energy <br>
                    and liquids, both in quality and quantity, always adapted and personalized to the <br>

                    The needs of carbohydrates (cereals, rice, legumes, bread, pasta, potato ...) are increased, <br>
                    the diet will be high in this nutrient and the recommendation is based on ingesting throughout <br>
                    the day between 5-7 g / kg of body weight, when the workouts last one hour; and above 7 g per kilo <br>
                    if they exceed the hour of duration. The goal is to be able to perform at its best, delay the onset <br>
                    of tiredness and fatigue, recover glycogen stores after training and, therefore, reduce the physical <br>
                    stress of the body. <br>

                    more than 90 minutes, it will favor that the runner has a high performance and that he can better tolerate <br>

                    MSome people preparing for the marathon aim to adjust the percentage of body fat, in these cases, the carbohydrate <br>
                    intake is 3-5 g / kg of body weight and does not cover the recommendations described above. Thus, training may not <br>
                    be so demanding and performance will not be the priority objective. The restriction of caloric intake will be based <br>
                    above all on the reduction of fat consumption; Likewise, an intake of carbohydrates at each meal and <br>
                    an adequate consumption of proteins and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) should be ensured. <br>

                <p>
                    The 2-3 days prior to the marathon it is advisable to significantly reduce physical <br>
                    exercise and perform a carbohydrate overload of 9-12 g / kg of body weight to cover <br>
                    energy needs and fill glycogen stores to the maximum. Thus, the day before abundant <br>
                    carbohydrates will be taken, a certain protein load, digestible and with little fat <br>
                    (chicken or white fish) and fatty foods will be avoided as they slow digestion, spicy, <br>
                    fibrous and ferment in the intestine such as whole foods, vegetables and legumes. <br>
                    Drink water throughout the day. <br>

                    On the day of the competition you should never try any new food, neither at breakfast <br>
                    nor in the nutritional strategies that will later be followed in the course of the marathon <br>
                    since the risk of possible gastrointestinal discomfort must be avoided. Breakfast should be <br>
                    made about 3 hours before starting the test, should contain between 100 and 300 g of carbohydrates, <br>
                    and should consist of foods with low fat and fiber content, in addition to avoiding foods that can <br>
                    cause flatulence, irritating or spicy. <br>

                <h3>Examples of breakfast would be:</h3>

    <div id="Hydration">
        <h2><em>Hydration during the marathon</em></h2>
        <p>
            In the first hour of the race you can drink 300 ml of water or isotonic drink and, depending on the weight of the <br>
            athlete, between 30 and 60 g of carbohydrates every hour, the best tolerated products are gels and isotonic drink. <br>
            After 60 minutes, it is advisable to hydrate with isotonic drink that will provide carbohydrates and electrolytes <br>
            that are lost with sweat, such as sodium. Keep in mind that the increase in body temperature that occurs when running <br>
            this test, makes the risk of dehydration high, thus increasing cardiovascular stress on the body. Therefore, fluid <br>
            intake will be between 400 and 800 ml / hour, but these recommendations will always have to be adjusted individually <br>
            since sweating varies between each athlete according to; Body size, degree of training, sex, running pace and <br>
            environmental conditions. <br>
            It is very important not to overestimate sweat losses, slower, smaller runners or those who take 4 hours or more to <br>
            reach the goal, should not exceed fluid intake and your recommendation will be around 400 ml / hour. You have to drink <br>
            as you lose fluid and not ingest it above sweat losses. Therefore, it is essential that athletes adopt strategies that <br>
            allow them to become familiar with their sweat rate, such as weighing themselves before and after competition. In some runners, <br>
            the intake of small doses of caffeine consumed in cola, sports drinks or in some gels, can be beneficial in the last hour <br>
            of competition. <br>

        <h2><em>¿What to eat after the marathon?</em></h2>
        <p>
            Once the marathon is over, attention must be paid to the recovery to ensure that it is as complete as possible. At the <br>
            nutritional level, it is recommended to drink a shake with a carbohydrate/protein ratio of 4:1 and with sodium content, <br>
            always within an hour after the end of the competition. Then, the food should guarantee the restoration of the hydromineral <br>
            balance, be rich in vegetables and fruit to reduce acidosis, contain an abundance of carbohydrates to recover glycogen levels <br>
            and some protein food to promote protein synthesis. <br>
